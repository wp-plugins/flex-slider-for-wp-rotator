Turns WP Rotator into FlexSlider, a fully responsive jQuery slider.

== Description ==

WP Rotator is a powerful and customizable rotator plugin for WordPress. This plugin extends it, replacing the default javascript and markup with that of [FlexSlider](http://flex.madebymufffin.com/), so that it will scale down with your website on smaller screens (assuming your design scales down as well).

You must have the WP Rotator plugin installed for this to work.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-rotator` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Upload `flex-slider-for-wp-rotator` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate both plugins through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Settings > WP Rotator to configure


== Changelog ==
